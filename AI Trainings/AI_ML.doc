Model - used to predict results by forming mathematical relationships within the data provided

Types of MLs

    Supervised learning
    Unsupervised learning
    Reinforcement learning
    Generative AI

Supervised learning - using data from events that have taken place correctly to produce results that fit with the requirements.

    Regression - predicts numerical value - amt of rainfall (inches/mm)
    Classification - predicts what category an item belongs to

    Binary - one of 2 categories (rain or no rain)
    Multiclass - more categories (rain, hail, sleet, snow)

Unsupervised Learning - All data is considered and the data is studied by the model. Different results are grouped into clusters (process called clustering) to make the given data make sense. The model infers the data using it’s own rules.

Clustering is not categorization as the clusters are not formed by us but by the model

Reinforcement Learning - A model that is given rewards or treats based on the results it provides thus reinforcing it. Like training a robot to walk or do something

Generative AI - Generates content from user input

text-to-text/video/audio/image/code (image and text)-to-image

core concepts -

    Data
    Model
    Training
    Evaluating
    Inference

Data -

words, letters, images, waveforms (audio)

dataset - data is stored as such

Dataset - consists of features and label

for rainfall prediction model

    features - lattitude, longtitudde, wind direction, cloud coverage, humidity, temperature and atmospheric pressure
    label - Rainfall amount

examples that contain both label and features are called labeled examples

unlabeled examples - no label and only features’

Datasets - size and diversity

    Good datasets - large and highly diverse
    large no doesn’t guarantee diversity and highly diversity doesn’t mean sufficient examples
    example - rainfall predicting model
        model of one year but all months included (seasons) has diversity but less examples of rainfall
        model of only July of every month to predict rainfall in January - no diversity but large dataset
    Higher number of features also favourable - but if features don’t have any relationship to model then this can fail

Model - Complex collection of numbers that define mathematical relationships from input feature patterns to output label values - models discover this pattern through training

Training - models are provided multiple labeled examples - and they eventually work out the best solution for predicting the labels from the features. The models compare the label’s predicted value with it’s actual value. based on loss (the difference between the predicted and the actual value) the model updates its solution. It learns the mathematical relationship between the features and the label - to make best predictions on unseen data. Also the reason why large and diverse datasets are best. ML Practitioners can remove or add features to see if the accuracy of prediction is different.

Evaluating - to know how well it learned - using labeled dataset but only provide the features to see the label values it returns and compare to the actual values

Depending on these values more training and evaluation is done

Inference - model can now make predictions on unlabeled datasets
