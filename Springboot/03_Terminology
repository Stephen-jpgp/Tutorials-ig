@Component - instance of class that will be managed by Spring Framework
           - Spring bean is created and managed by Spring framework

Dependency - 

Component Scan - to know where the components are
               - provide the path to where the components are
               - if without path then current path is used

Dependency Injection - Identify beans, dependencies and wire them together (provides IOC - inversion of control)
* Spring beans
* IoC container (ApplicationContext or BeanFactory)
    IOC - why is it called that?
        - control shifts from programmer to spring framework

Autowiring - process of figuring out what are the dependencies required for a Spring Bean
