@Component - Generic annotation applicable for any class
    1. Base for all spring stereotype annotations
    2. Specializations of @Component
        2.1. @Service - indicates that an annotated clawss has business logic
        2.2. @Controller - indicates class is a controller (web controller)
        2.3. @Repository - Indicates annotated class is used to retrieve and or manipulate data in a database

What's to be used? use the most specific annotation possible
    why? - this way we give more info about our intentions to the framework
    we can use AOP (aspect oriented programming) at a later point to add additional behavior
